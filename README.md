# human-activity-prediction
The goal of this project is to collect and analyze accelerometer data and build a machine learning model to predict human movement. 
This was done as a self-directed term group project for CMPT 353 (https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2021/fall/courses/cmpt/353.html) at Simon Fraser University.

The original project repo can be found at https://github.com/Pydiot-353/Pydiot.
