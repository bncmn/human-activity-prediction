# human-activity-prediction
This is a Data Science project where we collect and analyze accelerometer data and build a machine learning model to predict human movement. 
This was done as a group term project for my data science course at Simon Fraser University (CMPT 353 - Computational Data Science).
The original project repo can be found at https://github.com/Pydiot-353/Pydiot.
